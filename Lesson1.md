# Introduction to Go

----

#### What is Go: 
Go, or Golang, is a programming language created and maintained by Google. Here's what Google says about Go, straight from their [documentation](https://go.dev/doc/)

### Why developers choose to build with Go
While Go is a flexible general-purpose programming language, developers are particularly interested in Go for a few key characteristics:

#### Concurrency (Goroutines)

Concurrent functions can run independently – that is, they don’t need to depend on another function to execute or finish before executing. Through the use of Goroutines, Go provides an easy and inexpensive way to create multiple processes that execute independently.

For now, don't worry too much more about what a concurrent function is, nor how a Goroutine is built. We'll go into both of them in great detail later on in this course.


#### Cloud and microservices

Go supports cloud-native development, and makes it easy to deploy, scale, and optimize cloud-based servers for performance. If you're interested in careers in cloud development, learning Go is a great place to begin!

#### Compiling

Go is fast. It's super quick to compile project code on nearly any machine. This makes it incredibly versatile and easy to run on a variety of different operating systems and architectures, including virtual machines.


#### Garbage collection

Go is also great at memory management, and this is implemented in Go under the hood through its use of a garbage collector. While it's not required for this course, if you're curious about its implementation of garbage collection, you can check out [Getting to Go: The Journey of Go's Garbage Collector from the official Go blog.](https://go.dev/blog/ismmkeynote)
